# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This uses a kaggle dataset called Heart Disease UCI. 
Source : https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci  

There are 13 attributes in the dataset which contribute towards a patient having heart disease.

We performed preprocessing, descriptive analytics and predictive analytics on the dataset. Refer to the jupyter notebooks in the same order.

The original dataset is titled "heart.csv". After preprocessing, the dataset was stored as "after_preprocessing.csv" which was used in further analysis.

8 different models were trained and tested on the dataset for prediction of heart disease. These models are stored separately in the folder titled "models". This folder may be used to load any one of the trained models. The training and testing accuracy of the models may be found in "model_results.csv".
